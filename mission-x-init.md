# Mission X Init File

## Code structure and organisation

- Folders Structure:
 ```
    public
    src
        assets
        components
            ComponentOne
                ComponentOne.jsx
                ComponentOne.module.css
            ComponentTwo
                ComponentTwo.jsx
                ComponentTwo.module.css
```

- Folders Names: kebab-case ?
- Variables Names: camelCase && declarative variables/function ex: firstName || loginHandler || 
- Prettier Config
- line lenght characters -> Chat GPT told me is important



## First Questions



## First Suggestions

- I'll set up a few code snippets, more than happy to share and having you guys playing/adding to it

- Let's all go through the Rubric document and decide on the MVP for Mission X

- A thought on general Components That we can build and everyone can use ( Those can be our top one priority )
    -- From here we can break who is doing their respective pages.

-   Each of us can express what do we like or dislike about dev ex: Coding, Design, Research. 
    And we can try our best to give everyone a bit of fun ( although we all will do something we dont really like eventually haha )
